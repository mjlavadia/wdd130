            <p>Hello! My name is Mahonri Jared Lavadia and I am from Palwan, Philippines. I enjoy watching movies and series. 
                I really like how movies and TV shows can tell you a lot about a certain culture and sense of humor. Recently, I've been enjoying US TV show like Young Sheldon and The Good Place and I really liked it. 
                I am also a student in BYU and I am taking online courses and striving to finish a bachelor in software development. I want to be someone who can help others</p>
